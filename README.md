### What is this

ou type in a location (city or country) and it will return the 5 day forecasted weather data for that location. The user can add as many locations as they wish.

### Why was it built

This site was built to practice using apis. I used the OpenWeatherMap api to pull in weather data and the algolia api to pull in country/city names for the search field.

### Main technologies used
Javascript, Algolia, OpenWeatherMap Api
 
#### Live site
